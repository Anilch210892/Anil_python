Python *args and **kwargs
In programming, we define a function to make a reusable code that performs similar operation.
To perform that operation, we call a function with the specific value,
this value is called a function argument in Python.

We would recommend you to read Python Function and Python Function Arguments.

Suppose, we define a function for addition of 3 numbers.

Example 1: Function to add 3 numbers
def adder(x,y,z):
    print("sum:",x+y+z)

adder(10,12,13)
When we run the above program, the output will be

sum: 35
In above program we have adder() function with three arguments x, y and z.
When we pass three values while calling adder() function,
 we get sum of the 3 numbers as the output.

Lets see what happens when we pass more than 3 arguments in the adder() function.

def adder(x,y,z):
    print("sum:",x+y+z)

adder(5,10,15,20,25)
