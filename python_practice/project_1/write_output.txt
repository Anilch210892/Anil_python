Essex are through to the final! They were faced with a truncated run-chase of 115 in 12 overs,
 looked in trouble after losing 3 wickets quickly in the middle,
  but some quickfire cameos have powered them over the line.
  The bowling from Hampshire also was quite ordinary for large parts.
   You could argue they were hampered by rain after posting a decent 170 on the board in 20 overs.
   But they did find a way to get on top, having Essex at 50/4 with the required rate over 12.
   But Daniel Sams and Matthew Critchley combined to put on 45 in just over 3 overs.
   Sams was dismissed, but Critchley powered on, and Harmer sealed it with a big hit in the final over.
