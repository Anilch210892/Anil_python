Q17. How is memory managed in Python?
Ans: Memory is managed in Python in the following ways:

Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space.
All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap.
 The programmer does not have access to this private heap.
 The python interpreter takes care of this instead.
The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Pythonâ€™s memory manager.
 The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.
Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector,
which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space.
